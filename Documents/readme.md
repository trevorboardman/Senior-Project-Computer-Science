LWC is a counseling company. Recently they have been losing money due to insufficient counseling session time logging. Our goal and solution for this project is to implement an accurate logging system that will tell the client exactly how long a session lasted. 
Our approach to this project is to solve the problem by installing an RFID card reader in a central location at LWC. This RFID scanner would connect to an Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi system. When a counseling sessions starts, the counselor will scan the room key fob, the counselor id card and the client id card in any order. Once the counseling session is over, the counselor will scan the room key fob as they exit the room. Each scan will be processed by a script that is installed on the Ubuntu system. The information will then be sent to a database installed on a server with related timestamps for each scan along with the relative information of both the client and the counselor. LWC will then be able to analyze the information at the end of the day by accessing a web page that shows the information and bill insurance companies directly.
